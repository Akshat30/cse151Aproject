## Introduction:
Dataset: [Spotify Songs Information](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lilycarew/spotify-songs-information/data)

### Abstract:

This project will aim to predict the popularity of new songs that are released on Spotify, , a popular music streaming platform. For context, Spotifyâ€™s API allows developers to access lots of information about songs through an endpoint. This information includes quantitative features such as danceability, tempo, instrumentalness, and more. The dataset linked contains the Spotify calculated features for 10130 songs, from different genres. We will be adding the feature of popularity to this dataset by fetching the popularity (scale of 1-100) from the Spotify API for each of the songs and storing it in a column. We will be using sci-kit learn to create a model that will be able to predict the popularity of a given song, based on its features. We will begin with a basic linear regression model as our baseline model, using results from the baseline model to move on to more advanced models such as decision tree and random forest regressors. We will also consider feature engineering, to see whether some features together may affect the popularity. Even though Spotify offers popularity as a metric for songs, this model will be useful to be able to predict the future popularity of songs, as the popularity value of songs changes over time. For example, for a new song that is released, we can input the metrics regarding danceability, instrumentalness, and other features (by fetching from Spotify API), and then receive a prediction on how popular the song will become from our model.


### Description:
This data set has over 10,000 songs with 21 nonindex features. The data is from Spotify, a popular music streaming platform. This dataset was found on kaggle, and is contained in a single 3.16 mb csv file. The features, as collected by Spotify and accessible through its API, are as follows:
- Danceability: Score 0-1
- Energy: Score 0-1
- Key: Integer describing the key 0-11
- Loudness: -45-0
- Mode: 0-1
- speechiness: 0-1 describes the ratio of vocals to sound
- Accousticness; 0-1
- Instrumentals: 0-1 describes the ratio of instrumentals to sound
- Valence: 0-1
- Tempo: 0-220 in BPM
- Type: 2 classes 
- Id: identifies the track on spotify
- Uri: Uniform Resource Identifier
- Track_href: We may use this to collect additional data
- Analysis_url: Link to analysis of the track
- Duration: Int in ms describing the length
- Time_signature: notes per bar
- Song_name: string of the name
- Artist: string with artist name

### Importing popularity data from the Spotify API
As our abstract states, our goal is to predict the popularity for the songs based on the other factors in the dataset. However, because the dataset does not contain the popularity for each song, we wrote a python script that fetched the popularities for each song and added it as a column `popularity` in our csv. The python script can be found in the Code, titled `fetch_popularity.py`.

We did run into an issue, which is that for a good amount of songs (even really popular ones), Spotify returns 0 as the popularity.

## Data Exploration:
From the Jypter Notebook linked above, we have these key insights:
- 10130 total entries
- 23 columns
- 14 of which are numerical (not counting entry as it just the row number)
- danceability, energy, key, loudness, mode, and speechiness are each missing 3 entries
- artist is missing 26 entries (that is OK as we will likely not be using it)

The information regarding columns can be found in the description section above.

**As mentioned above, the Spotify API was returning 0 for the popularity for a good amount of songs. After data exploration, this number was found to be 2479 out of 10130 songs. **

## Data Preprocessing PLAN:
One of our first plans is to research how to fix the issue of songs having a popularity of 0. After some research we found out that this may be happening because we did not specify the correct market for the song, which is why it was returning 0 for those songs. [Source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75572315/spotipy-popularity-value-is-different-than-the-value-retrieved-from-spotify-api).

As a result, we will be going through and refetching the popularity for songs with 0 in our data, this time specifying 'US' as the market.

In addition, after analyzing the heatmap and pairplots, it is evident that the other values are not well correlated with popularity (the highest column being instrumentallness with a value of -0.29). Thus we are aiming to improve this by:
- fetching more factors from the Spotify API and plotting those
- adding more entries such as liveness, start_of_fade_out, start_of_fade_in, time signature, and pitches (meaning we get data for more songs from the Spotify API)
- quantifying categorical values, such as genre, to help provide an additional factor for our model

# Milestone 3

## Preprocessing Data
Liam

We went through and refetched the popularity for songs that had a popularity of 0 originally. This time, we specified the market to be US, and had backup countries in case the popularity for the US was 0. After going through and updating these values, the number of songs with a popularity of 0 went from 2479 to 195. This gave us 2284 more datapoints to work with, allowing our training to be better.
